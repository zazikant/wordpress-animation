Do Tag Sequencing, fire this before: 

Library - GSAP _ScrollTrigger_Confirmation


Trigger: DOM Ready

========

Additional hack: the outer parent container can have a class name and scroll trigger based animation with GSAP to may be display none to visible or some smooth animation.
Then,when its completed, you can have buttons to play the button -linked animation.
